#%% This file calculates the flux of the threshold-triggered removal of CH4 
# I set up an artificial reaction in PFLOTRAN to simulate the ebullition process, in which CH4 is removed when CH4 concentration is above the threshold
# I have three different methods to calculate the ebullition flux below

#%% Method 1ï¼š Calculate the difference between theorectical CH4 concentration and the threshold

#Import parameters of the simulation domain
Thickness = np.reshape([[0.25]*100, [0.2]*100, [0.1]*100, [0.075]*100, [0.05]*100, [0.015]*100, [0.005]*100, [0.003]*100, [0.002]*100] , (1,900))

Porosity = 0.8

# 1) Calculate the theoretical CH4 concentration assuming there is no ebullition
# Because the concentration of CH4 calculated by PFLOTRAN would always be lower than the threshold (otherwise the extra would be removed),
# I could not use the CH4 concentration reported by PFLOTRAN to calculate the rate of ebullition.
# I need to first calculate what the theoretical CH4 concentration on next day would be if there is no ebullition.

ch4_tomorrow = ch4_today + ch4_increase   #the CH4 concentration on day30 if there is no ebullition going on  

# 2) Calculate the extra CH4 relative to the threshold concentration, which would be the ebullition efflux in my model framework
