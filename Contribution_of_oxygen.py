# This file calculates the respective contribution of different pathways of O2 impacts on CH4
# root O2 release impacts CH4 cycling via three pathways:
# 1) enhance CH4 oxidation
# 2) inhibit methanogenesis
# 3) enhance H2S oxidation to produce more SO42-, so enhance sulfate reduction and reduce the OM substrate, so reduce methanogenesis
